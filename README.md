# GANji: real looking fake kanji
## Description
The purpose of this project was to explore various AI image generation technique's ability to recreate Japanese Kanji. The methods tried were a Variational AutoEncoder, a Generative Adversarial Network, and a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model. Each of these techniques were used to train various models on a dataset of about 10,000 images of standard font Kanji.
